## Description
This project is built with Vue 2, Vue-CLI 3 and several tools. The content include the introduction of various resort services and hotel booking feature.

Tourists can make a reservation. They could also check their booking status from the site or either cancel their trip.

Comments and contributions will be appreciated. I am doing this for practicing different development skills.
